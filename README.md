Learning two in one:
- grow my basic lisp knowledge by writing another Scheme dialect
- write (and test) it in Go, which I still need to learn

I'm starting with the testing, since I have a suite in python which
I can effectively trace into Go using some go [https://pkg.go.dev/testing ](unittest docs) [https://gobyexample.com/testing ](and examples).
This is also reinforcing my TDD habits by thinking through the test 
cases first.
